/**
 * Immutable projection of one MediaStore audio row.
 *
 * Missing metadata remains null so presentation code can resolve a localized fallback at render time.
 * [contentUri] is a string form of the row URI and can be reopened through ContentResolver.
 * [titleSectionKey] and [titleSortKey] keep the displayed order aligned with the fast index.
 * [dateAddedEpochSeconds], [dateModifiedEpochSeconds], [fileName], and [fileSizeBytes] preserve
 * MediaStore values used by sorting and artwork-cache invalidation. [albumId] keeps the stable
 * MediaStore album identity, [mediaStoreId] retains the source row ID when [id] is made globally
 * unique across storage volumes, while [folderPath] is the normalized direct parent directory used
 * by the folder library. Optional audio format fields come from TagLib and support quality badges.
 * [audioPropertiesScanned] distinguishes an unreadable file from an older snapshot that has not
 * attempted the descriptor-based read yet.
